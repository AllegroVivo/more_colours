# More Colours!

This is an add-in discord.py module providing an additional 186 colour options.

The attached excel file is a color cheat sheet showing samples of each along with their name and hex code.

Additionally, I've included a few extra random methods in case you know what general color you want, but can't decide on the exact shade.

```python
random_red()
random_pink()
random_orange()
random_yellow()
random_purple()
random_green()
random_cyan()
random_blue()
random_brown()
random_white()
random_grey()```
